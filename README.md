# css-grid-sample-landing-page
A demonstration of CSS responsive grid layout for a simple website /landing page.

This code is outcome of a video that explains how a responsive grid for a website can be created - 

Inspired by Traversy Media's video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moBhzSC455o. I don't quite create videos, but this gentleman provided the inspiration to start. So, thank you. I wanted to play around with existing content and see how I could change presentation of concepts.
